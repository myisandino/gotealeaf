"Amid Controversy, Construction of Telescope In Hawaii Halted",http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/nR9RPY4MYfA/amid-controversy-construction-of-telescope-in-hawaii-halted,"An anonymous reader sends word that Hawaii Gov. David Ige has asked for a week-long hold in the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope atop Mauna Kea. ""After more than a week of demonstrations and dozens of arrests, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said Tuesday that the company building one of the world's largest telescopes atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea has agreed to his request to halt construction for a week. 'They have responded to my request and on behalf of the president of the University and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs have agreed to a time out on the project, and there will be no construction activities this week,' Ige said at a news conference. Thirty Meter Telescope is constructing the telescope on land that is held sacred to some Native Hawaiians. Scientists say the location is ideal for the telescope, which could allow them to see into the earliest years of the universe. Ige said he hopes the temporary pause in construction will allow the interested parties to have more discussions about the project. Native Hawaiian groups have been protesting the construction of the telescope since its inception last year.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Ask Slashdot: What Would a Constructed Language Have To Be To Replace English?,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/KV6cRGkL8ls/ask-slashdot-what-would-a-constructed-language-have-to-be-to-replace-english,"Loren Chorley writes: The idea of constructing a language capable of replacing English has fascinated me for a long time. I'd like to start a project with some of my own ideas and anyone who's interested, but I'd really like to hear what the Slashdot community thinks on the topic first. Taking for granted that actually replacing English is highly unlikely, what characteristics would the new language need? More specifically: How could the language be made as easy as possible to learn coming from any linguistic background? How could interest in the language be fostered in as many people as possible? What sort of grammar would you choose and why? How would you build words and how would you select meanings for them, and why? What sounds and letters (and script(s)) would you choose? How important is simplicity and brevity? How important are aesthetics (and what makes a language aesthetic)? What other factors could be important to consider, and what other things would you like to see in such a language?<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

"Collision With Earth's ""Little Sister"" Created the Moon",http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/og_nZd6ghOc/collision-with-earths-little-sister-created-the-moon,"astroengine writes The primordial planet believed to have smashed into baby Earth, creating a cloud of debris that eventually formed into the moon, was chemically a near-match to Earth, a new study shows. The finding, reported in this week's Nature, helps resolve a long-standing puzzle about why Earth and the moon are nearly twins in terms of composition. Computer models show that most of the material that formed the moon would have come from the shattered impactor, a planetary body referred to as Theia, which should have a slightly different isotopic makeup than Earth.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Obama Says Climate Change Is Harming Americans' Health,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Ix8tOSio2Tw/obama-says-climate-change-is-harming-americans-health,"HughPickens.com writes: The Washington Post reports on new comments from President Obama, who says global warming isn't just affecting the weather &mdash; it's harming Americans' health. He has announced steps government and businesses will take to better understand and deal with the problem. Obama said hazards of the changing climate include wildfires sending more pollution into the air, allergy seasons growing longer, and rising cases of insect-borne diseases. ""We've got to do better in protecting our vulnerable families,"" said Obama. ""You can't cordon yourself off from air."" 

Speaking at Howard University Medical School, Obama announced commitments from Google, Microsoft and others to help the nation's health system prepare for a warmer, more erratic climate. Google has promised to donate 10 million hours of advanced computing time on new tools, including risk maps and early warnings for things like wildfires and oil flares using the Google Earth Engine platform, the White House said. Google's camera cars that gather photos for its ""Street View"" function will start measuring methane emissions and natural gas leaks in some cities this year. Microsoft's research arm will develop a prototype for drones that can collect large quantities of mosquitoes, then digitally analyze their genes and pathogens.

Organic Molecules Found Circling Nearby Star,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Ti3Aj-vkIe4/organic-molecules-found-circling-nearby-star,"sciencehabit writes Astronomers have detected chemical precursors of building blocks of life in the large disk of dust and gas whirling around a young nearby star. These complex organic molecules, two forms of cyanide and one chemically related compound, likely formed after the protoplanetary disk collapsed, the researchers say. The same chemicals are found in roughly similar proportions in comets circling our sun, which may have brought them to Earth billions of years ago. ""We know that the solar system isn't unique in its number of planets or abundance of water,"" says Karin &#214;berg, an astrochemist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Two years ago, Desjardins began offering a telematic device that plugs into a vehicle's diagnostic port, to track acceleration, hard braking and the time of day you were driving, for instance. Now, there's no plug-in device required. With Desjardins's new Ajusto app, all you need is your smartphone.

""After losing a sex-discrimination lawsuit in Silicon Valley last week, Ellen Pao continues on her crusade to bring gender equality to the tech world, but this time with a focus on her home turf. As Reddit&rsquo;s interim CEO, Pao said she wants to eliminate salary negotiations from the company&rsquo;s hiring process. In her first interview since the lawsuit, Pao told with the Wall Street Journal Monday that the plan would help level the playing field. 'Men negotiate harder than women do and sometimes women get penalized when they do negotiate,' she said. 'So as part of our recruiting process we don&rsquo;t negotiate with candidates. We come up with an offer that we think is fair. If you want more equity, we&rsquo;ll let you swap a little bit of your cash salary for equity, but we aren&rsquo;t going to reward people who are better negotiators with more compensation.'""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The Key To Interviewing At Google,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/mlAX5BvrAn8/the-key-to-interviewing-at-google,"Nerval's Lobster writes Wired has an excerpt from a new book of Google-centric workplace advice, written by Laszlo Bock, the search-engine giant's head of ""People Operations"" (re: Human Resources). In an interesting twist, Bock kicks off the excerpt by describing the brainteaser questions that Google is famous for tossing at job candidates as ""useless,"" before suggesting that some hiring managers at the company might still use them. (""Sorry about that,"" he offered.) Rather than ask candidates to calculate the number of golf balls that can fit inside a 747 (or why manhole covers are round), Google now runs its candidates through a battery of work-sample tests and structured interviews, which its own research and data-crunching suggest is best at finding the most successful candidates. Google also relies on a tool (known as qDroid), which automates some of the process&mdash;the interviewer can simply input which job the candidate is interviewing for, and receive a guide with optimized interview questions. It was only a matter of time before people got sick of questions like, ""Why are manhole covers round?""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

US Started Keeping Secret Records of International Telephone Calls In 1992,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/YdNWU4O1YEk/us-started-keeping-secret-records-of-international-telephone-calls-in-1992,"schwit1 writes Starting in 1992, the Justice Department amassed logs of virtually all telephone calls from the USA to as many as 116 countries. The now-discontinued operation, carried out by the DEA's intelligence arm, was the government's first known effort to gather data on Americans in bulk, sweeping up records of telephone calls made by millions of U.S. citizens regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime. It was a model for the massive phone surveillance system the NSA launched to identify terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks. That dragnet drew sharp criticism that the government had intruded too deeply into Americans' privacy after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked it to the news media two years ago. More than a dozen current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials described the details of the Justice Department operation to USA TODAY. Most did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence program, part of which remains classified. The operation had 'been approved at the highest levels of Federal law enforcement authority,' including then-Attorney General Janet Reno and her deputy, Eric Holder.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

eBay Sales Patterns Show That the Maker Movement is Still Growing (Video),http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/zXre9FnbwiE/ebay-sales-patterns-show-that-the-maker-movement-is-still-growing-video,"Meet Aron Hsaio. He works for Terapeak, a company that tracks sales through online venues such as eBay and Amazon in order to help merchants decide what to sell -- and how. The five 'maker' categories Terapeak tracks (drones, robotics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and 3D printing) outsold Star Trek-related merchandise by a huge amount, namely $33 million to $4.3 million, during a recent 90 day study period. Star Wars merchandise did better at $29.4 million, but still... And as another comparison, Aron says that all Apple laptops combined, new and used, sold $48.4 million, so the DIY hobbyist movement still has a ways to go before it catches up with Apple laptops -- but seems to be heading steadily in that direction.
 
Drones are the hottest hobbyist thing going right now, Aron says, but all five of the hobbyist/tinkerer' categories Terapeak tracks are growing steadily at a rate of up to 70% year over year, with drones leading the way and robotics trailing (but still growing). It's good to see people taking an interest in making things for themselves. If you remember (or have heard of) the Homebrew Computer Club, you have an idea of what tinkerers and hobbyists can produce if given even a tiny bit of encouragement. And it's good to see that the DIY mindset is not only still alive, but growing -- even if it seems to be moving away from traditional hobby tinkering (cars; radios) toward concepts (drones; robotics) that weren't considered mass market 'homebrew' possibilities even a few years ago.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
